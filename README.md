# Flight Price Checker

The name says everything :D


In version 1.0 i plan only to check flights to Barcelona between fixed dates. I plan to visit FC Barcelona match during that weekend and I am looking for the best fligt prices ;)

## How to use
### 1. Download this repository to your local machine

### 2. Create and activate virtual environment
In the console, navigate to the location of the repository files and type:
```python -m venv env```. "env" is a name of your virtual environment, you can change it as you wish.

To activate this environment type one of the following (depending on you OS)
* On Unix or MacOS, using the bash shell: ```source /path/to/venv/bin/activate```
* On Unix or MacOS, using the csh shell: ```source /path/to/venv/bin/activate.csh```
* On Unix or MacOS, using the fish shell: ```source /path/to/venv/bin/activate.fish```
* On Windows using the Command Prompt: ```path\to\venv\Scripts\activate.bat```
* On Windows using PowerShell: ```path\to\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1```

### 3. Install dependencies
With your venv activated, type ```pip install requirements.txt```. This command will install all required python modules.

### 4. Install web driver
To let Selenium work. There has to be a web driver installed in your machine. Each browser needs different driver. Here are the links to most popular ones:
* Chrome:	https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/
* Edge:	https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
* Firefox:	https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

The web driver has to be installed in PATH or its location should be specified in the code (if you choose the second option you will have to edit ```flights.py```). If you use browser other than Edge, then you should change the line 223 ```driver = webdriver.Edge()```.

For more information about drivers please refer the official documentation https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/

### 5. Run code
Python file responsible for web scraping is ```flights.py```. Run it and wait until the web scraping is done - in the terminal will appear following text:
```
-----------------------------
Web Scraping: SUCCEEDED
Unable to read 0 flights data
-----------------------------
Writing Data to File: SUCCEEDED
-----------------------------
```

There will be created a new directry named ```\data``` and a file inside it named ```flights_data.json```. This file contains all data from the begginning of your web scraping. You can use it to do analysis on your own or use my Jupyter notebook named  ```visualize.ipynb```.

### 6. Customize
This project was made in order to monitor prices of flights to Barcelona between fixed dates. Due to that fact there is no customisation provided. Although it is very easy to change origin, destination and dates. There are global constants at the beggining of the ```flights.py```. You can change them to customize your search. Be aware that there is no protection against saving different origin or destination data to one file.
```
DEPART_EARLIEST = datetime.date(2023, 2, 2)
DEPART_LATEST = datetime.date(2023, 2, 3)
RETURN_EARLIEST = datetime.date(2023, 2, 6)
RETURN_LATEST = datetime.date(2023, 2, 8)
DESTINATION = "Barcelona"
ORIGIN = "Kraków"
```
